# Permutations and Combinations 

### About

This program performs two kinds of counting from a set.

From pascalâ€™s triangle we expect the number of combinations to be

Size 0: 1
Size 1: 5
Size 2: 10
Size 3: 10
Size 4: 5
Size 5: 1

As an example, combinations of size 4 would give the following:

{A, B, C, D}
{A, B, C, E}
{A, B, D, E}
{A, C, D, E}
{B, C, D, E}

There are 5 combinations of size 4
