# Sets

## About

Program which assembles and displays various provided sets. 

A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} 
B = {2,4,6,8,10} 
C = {1,3,5,7,9} 
D = {1,2,3,5,7} 

### Features

1. Displays the result of operators on sets (such as Union and Intersection) 
2. Does NOT repeat any values that might appear more than once. If you Union two sets together that each have the number ‘5’ somewhere in them, then ‘5’ should only appear ONCE in the resulting set.  
3. If the resulting set is empty, indicates the empty set in some recognizable manner, such as displaying “Empty Set” or “E” or something similar.
