# Polynomials

### About

This program implements solution to Hilbertâ€™s tenth problem. You are given an input file with text representing polynomials and with that file find the Limits, Evals, and Zeroes. 

### Features

1. Limits: this function will take a polynomial as input, and return the max and min integers to search between
2. Eval: this function will take a polynomial and integer as input and will return the value of that polynomial at the integer.
3. Zeroes: this function will take a polynomial and a list of integers and will return which of the integers return zero on the polynomial
