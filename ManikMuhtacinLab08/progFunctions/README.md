# Iterative and Recucrision 

### About

This program performs several different functions in two different manners, iterative, and recursive. For the recursive portion of the program, it uses a function to pass data along. 

### Features

1. Given one number, calculate the factorial of that given number. i.e. 7! = 5,040
2. Given one number, and one power, calculate the number raised to that power: i.e. 5 ^ 2 =25.
3. Given two numbers, calculate the GCD. i.e. gcd (14, 21) = 7.
